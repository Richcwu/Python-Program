# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

AI Dentist

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An artificially intelligent system that will identify the teeth positions from different X-ray images and can hence decrease the workload for the dentists' assistants.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will essentially differentiate teeth positions from each X-ray image, which is the job of dentist assistants'. It will be executed on Matlab.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

The relationship between the project and cs1051 is the operation of lists and arrays and data structures like that.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will at least finish the organization and the arrangement of the X-ray images through Matlab. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to have to system to have an accuracy of at least 50 %.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I wish I could make the accuracy for the detection of the teeth positions to 80%.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be going over more papers and study on IEEE and finding out the right and most effective way to accomplish the mission. I would go over the research result to make sure that I'm on the right track.
