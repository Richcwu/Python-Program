Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've shifted the project's main goal from identifying teeth positions to identifying specific diseases. And I'm now at 50% in terms of progress. I have now successfully labeled the images of different teeth.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The training process has not yet been done. I am still working on the "classes" of the data.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

"Error using trainNetwork (line 184)
Invalid training data. The output size (4) of the last layer does not match the number of classes (1)."

I am still facing some technical tweaks like this.
